Assignment Brief:


Information Visualisation: Exploration & Communication Assignment (40% of grade)


The goal of this assignment is to design and create three distinct visualisations that illuminate some aspects of a complex quantitative dataset. A number of datasets have been provided – these have been selected because they contain a variety of categorical and quantitative attributes that lend themselves to different visualisation approaches. You must use one of the provided datasets.

Take a look at the different datasets provided and choose one to perform your analysis on. Develop a couple of initial questions you wish to address (e.g. What is the relationship between height and weight for Olympic athletes? How does it vary across sports?) and start to create visualisations to answer them. Your questions will likely evolve and be refined as you understand the dataset better. You may also wish to create initial exploratory visualisations (e.g. histograms, scatter plot matrices) to understand your data better and help frame your questions.

You may perform initial analysis in another tool (e.g. Tableau) but the submitted visualisations must be presented in Vega-Lite. You may perform data manipulation outside of the Vega-Lite environment, e.g. using Python, but you must make clear what transformations / filtering you have performed and make the processed data set available.

Your submission should contain distinct visualisations that address three different questions related to your dataset. By distinct I mean that they could not be simply generated using small multiples or using the repeat operators. Three bar charts that show the average height, average weight, and average age of Olympic athletes would not count as distinct visualisations. You must include a discussion of your visualisations – why you chose particular encodings, what alternatives you considered, and what the pros and cons are of the alternatives. You should give also provide some indication of the insight gained from the visualisations – what do they demonstrate and what have you learnt from them? See the sample solution for an example of what is expected in these sections.

The final visualisations must be presented in html pages using Vega-Lite (or Vega if you prefer). A sample template is provided – if you’re not familiar with HTML you can just open the files in a text editor and replace my text with yours. An online editor may help with basic HTML formatting.
I expect that you will generate many more visualisations than the three you submit. Make it clear that you have considered alternatives in your discussion of design issues. It’s easy to create radically different visualisations with minor changes in Vega-Lite so I recommend taking screen shots throughout your process so you can remember all of the alternatives you explored.
